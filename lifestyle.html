<h3> Koronet Pizza</h3>
<p>During my stay in NYC i have had the time to try out some new things includin a lot of new (and good) food. One place that has really stood out to me is one that is actually located really close to campus, Koronet Pizza. Aside from having amazing pizza they also have amazinggly big pizza! They have several different size options but even their smallest option is at least as big as two slices of normal pizza! My friends and I have often found ourselves wandering back to Koronet pizza time and time again while trying to find a place to get food...</p> </a>

<h3>Excercise</h3>
<p>Being in a Pre-College program has helped me learn more about how I want to organize my days and my schedule and one thing that I always tried to include in my schedule was excercise. I think excercise is very important for people's health in general, physically as well as emotionally. I usually try to go running or o to the gym at least three to four times a week. I usually like to run in the park in the morning because it relaxes me and gets me energized for the day!</p></a>
