<h3>Books</h3>
<p> Summer is always a great time to catch up on some reading! During the school year I always have too much work and reading to do for my classes that it is nearly impossible to do any independent reading. But when summer comes around I always like to pick up a feew books other than my summer reading to read. I love reading when traveling; duriing long car rides, in the plane, at the beach... At the moment I am reading a book called "Orphan Train" by Christina Baker Kline. The book follows the story of a young girl and an old lady who seem to be very different but share similar stories. Though I have not read much yet, so far I really like it :) </p></a>

<h3>Music</h3>
<p>I have always loved listening to music. I like to listen to music no matter what I am doing, wether I am in the car, doing homework, running and working out or simply hanging out with friends. Lately I have been listening to a lot of relaxing music and remixes which I find perfect for chilling out in the summer or listening to while doing homework or studying as a way to relieve some stress. To hear some of the music I have been loving lately you can follow me on Spotify or check out my youtube channel.</p></a>
