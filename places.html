<p>This summer I spent four weeks in NYC with the Barnard 4-week Pre-College Program (this is my last week; I leave on Staurday). Ihave had an amazing time here exloring the city, meeting new people, learning in and out of class, trying things I never had thought I would do before. Though at times we had  lot of homework for our classes, I was never too stressed out and my classes taught me a lot. Also I have made some amazing new friends who I know I will stay in touch with and continue to be friends with for a long ime after this program ends. Overall, it has been an amazing amazing experience and I have loved every bit of it.</p></a>

<a name="bos"><h3>Boston</h3>
<p>I like Boston... I live a bit outside of Boston, in Wellesley (MA) so I go to Boston on the weekends when I have time with my friends. But I had been in Boston even before moving, which is where my love for the city comes from. My mother studied in Boston and we went back offten when we visited the US. She showed me and my sister around the city and told us about her experience there and her stories about the city. Now, though it is years later and I am no longer going into Boston with y mother, but with my friends, the city always reminds me of the summers I spent there with my mom and my sister and the memories we made together.</p></a>
